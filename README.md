# cmc you later!

**CMC You Later!** uses a neural network trained on data gathered from myself and my roommates to receive and execute voice commands to remotely perform gestures like swiping and tapping on an iPhone.

## about

This project came about as a result of me reading an excruciatingly long web novel series throughout the entirety of a 12 hour flight, absolutely wrecking my carpometacarpal (CMC) joint with all the repetitive scrolling.

After some initial panic and then recovery, I had learned three new things about myself:
1) I thankfully did not have osteoarthritis.
2) I do not want to develop it in the future.
3)  But, I still want to have that self-indulgent phone time on long car/plane rides...

And thus my baby was born!
